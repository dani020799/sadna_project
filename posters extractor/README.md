This script is using OMDb API to get all posters for the netflix_titles.csv we got at /datasets folder.
Make sure you have API key and place it inside a file called 'key' in this folder.
This will run and save queries into text file named 'netflix_posters.txt' at /datasets folder.
Notice: OMDb API allows only 1000 daily queries per day, so processing all titles and their posters takes about 9 days. As such, there will be netflix_poseters.txt file prepared in datasets.
