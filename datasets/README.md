In this folder we should have three datasets:
- name.basics.tsv
- title.ratings.tsv
- netflix_titles.csv
- netflix_posters.txt

'name.basics.tsv' and 'title.ratings.tsv' can be found their archives at: https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/ 
Extract both archives and move the .tsv files to this folder (datasets)
'netflix_titles.csv' can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows
Download and move the .csv file to this folder (datasets).
'netflix_posters.txt' can made by using 'posters extractor' script, using OMDb API. 
You need API key to use it, which you place inside of 'key' file at 'posters extractor'.
